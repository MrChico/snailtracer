# Acknowledgements

The SnailTracer project is an extended Solidity port of [Kevin Beason's `smallpt`](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)
global illumination C++ path tracer. Although it is a complete rewrite that underwent heavy modifications, simplifications
and extensions, none of this would have been possible without Kevin's awesome work and [Dr. David Cline's presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8g97JkuSSBwUENiWTJXeGtTOHFmSm51UC01YWtCZw/view).
Thank you!
